# This task definitely is not finished
It doesn't contain any report, everything valuable - below:

You can check out notebooks - they contain the basic stuff that I'm sure all other candidates did.
I did it on crops to eleminate confusion when you think on big image that you got a lot of keypoints so you could see that performance is really poor.
A saw a an atricle on Medium and used code from Quantum repo to obtain data.
I'm gonna slow down a pace but i already found i repo (basically fork of LoFTR) that i will customize to tune LoFTR.
I read this paper https://arxiv.org/html/2409.02825v1 but i didn't help much considering my lack of experience with satellites.
I'm gonna tune LoFTR not because it's a better fit (probably SuperPoint+LightGlue - best according to paper) but because tuning LoFTR
is doable comparing to rewriting cvg/glue-factory repository to do two step tuning of SuperPoint+LightGlue with custom data (it's just lack of skills, i don't think it's generally really hard task).
Also i need to investigate how to prepare dataset for tuning.
